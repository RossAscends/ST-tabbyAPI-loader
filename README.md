# TabbyAPI Loader

Load and unload models with [TabbyAPI](https://github.com/theroyallab/tabbyAPI)

## Features

TabbyAPI is an AI inference API using the exllamav2 backend. This API supports model loading and unloading, but that support is not in SillyTavern by default. The extension aims to bridge that.
